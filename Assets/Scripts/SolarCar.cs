// Derived class that inherits from the base class "Car"
/* Explanation
Inheritance
1. Base Class Constructor Call:
- The SolarCar constructor uses : base(...) to initialize shared properties (e.g., name, TopSpeed, Acceleration) defined in the Car base class.
- This ensures that common initialization logic doesn't need to be reimplemented in SolarCar.
2. Shared Properties:
currentSpeed, currentFuel, and MaxFuel are inherited from the Car class and reused in SolarCar without redefinition.
3. Shared Behavior:
The base.Move() method is called to reuse the Car classâ€™s behavior for increasing speed and consuming fuel, ensuring that SolarCar behaves like any other car before adding its own specific functionality.

Polymorphism
1. Method Overriding:
The Move() method in SolarCar overrides the virtual Move() method in the Car class. This allows SolarCar to extend the behavior of the base class by adding the Recharge() functionality.

2. Runtime Behavior:
If a Car reference points to a SolarCar object, calling Move() will execute the SolarCar version of the method, including recharging logic. This demonstrates runtime polymorphism.

Why It Matters
Inheritance: Simplifies code reuse by allowing SolarCar to build on top of Car without duplicating its common attributes and behaviors.
Polymorphism: Enables flexible behavior, allowing the system to handle all Car objects uniformly while respecting their specific differences at runtime.
